# Categorical-Crime-Rate-Analysis-and-Prediction
Abstratct: There exist multiple types of crimes, each having specific requirements/methods of prevention, ways of protection etc. Crime incidences can be eliminated/reduced by tending to a specific type of crime and implementing discrete precautionary methods. For this, we need to develop a deeper understanding of causes, patterns, consequences of crimes across different categories. Moreover, to develop effective and humane means for preventing crimes, we must understand its causes and in turn, the relation with crime rates. Hence, our aim is to predict categorical crime rate using its relation with various factors like GDP, Unemployment, Tourism etc. To achieve this, we propose our own combinational model methodology and analyze their relation with multiple factors.
